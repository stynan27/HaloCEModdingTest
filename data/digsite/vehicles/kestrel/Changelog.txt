
Notes:
01_x is provided as is.
99_mac was reworked from 01_x with as much macworld and xbox stats preserved as possible.
Vehicle type changed from human plane to alien fighter 
as human plane was never finished to be player functional.
Antigrav points were added to mimic human plane hover.
Primary attack is warthog chainguns firing chaingun_99_mac bullets.
Secondary attack is rocket hog launchers firing missile_launcher_99_mac missiles.
